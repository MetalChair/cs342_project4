A cool hangout spot for net-savvy folks to play rad games of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock! Groovy!

## Here are the bugs we should take a look at:
1. When the player list is sent to the client, I'd like to pad all the strings it recieves to be of the same length. Currently the alignemnt is off and it looks a little cheap
2. When a user challenges a user that isn't on the server, there is no notification that their challenge failed. Nothing bad happens because of this, it's just confusing to the end user
3. We should probably limit player names to 64 characters...
4. I'm not 100% the game logic is perfect, it can be tested more
5. If someone wants to edit those 3 icons that have a white background so that their PNG files, it would be greatly appreciated
